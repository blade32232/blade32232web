## Stimulus 

Virtual environments can be configured anyway the user wishes. Two example configurations are shown in Figure 10. However, in order to improve performance and provide a more controlled environment, as few objects as possible should be used.

Following the previously mentioned approach, the default scenes pre-created for the users of the Tethered Flight Arena will consist of a clearing which contains 1 or 2 objects (trees, flowers). This clearing will be surrounded by several distant objects (trees) which are intended to break-up the horizon and provide markers for navigation.

This approach aims to reliably attract the tethered animal toward the key objects and then by adjusting certain parameters, e.g. object size and distance, we can alter and record the difference in behaviour.
