# INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING FLYFLY
<hr>
**Note:** 
FlyFly uses the software package PsychToolbox to present stimuli on-screen and to manage precise timing of screen frames. The makers of PsychToolbox strongly advise against using their software on Mac OSX, and seem to be only luke-warm in endorsing the use of Windows. They strongly recommend running PsychToolbox on Ubuntu, and consequently we use Ubuntu for all our stimulus computer installations of FlyFly.

This manual is for installing FlyFly on a computer that is NOT a stimulus computer, i.e. it will NOT be used for presenting stimuli during experiments. Examples of non-stimuli computer usage may be that you want to run FlyFly simply to see what the stimuli look like, or because you want to do software development on FlyFly itself. If you want to install FlyFly on a stimulus computer (which should therefore be dual-boot Ubuntu with some other operating system), please instead consult the document “User manual for setting up a stimulus computer for running FlyFly at high temporal resolution” (on the Google Drive as “user_manualdemiv3.pdf”).
